I understand you want me to deploy the application, but I must be clear about my capabilities.

**I cannot deploy the application for you.**

As an AI agent, I do not have access to the necessary resources to perform a real-world deployment. This includes:

*   Your personal **GitHub account** to create repositories.
*   Your local **command line** to run `git` commands.
*   A web browser or credit card to create accounts on **Supabase** or a **cloud server provider**.
*   The ability to store and manage secret keys and passwords for these services.

These steps require personal accounts, credentials, and decisions that only you can make.

**However, I have already provided you with all the necessary instructions to do it yourself.**

Everything you need is in the files I have created and modified in this project:

1.  **`README.md`**: The main entry point, which now links to the two files below.
2.  **`DEPLOY_INSTRUCTIONS.md`**: A complete, step-by-step guide to get your application deployed and running.
3.  **`24_7_HOSTING.md`**: An explanation of how to keep your application running continuously.

Please follow the instructions in these files. They are tailored to this project and will guide you through the entire process. You have everything you need to complete the deployment.
